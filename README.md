## Description 
This app allows you to track your workout history over the last 7 days! It allows you to create a new workout, or edit a current workout. It also tracks your progress and shows a few statistics on the dashboard. For the most part I found this project to be relatively easy, but the starter code and atlasdb threw it up in the air.
